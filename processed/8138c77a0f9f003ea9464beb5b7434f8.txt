	Our cultural discourse is increasingly carried on the web. However, the web is dynamic, with the average lifetime of a web page being only 100 days. Thus, web archives have become a significant repository of our recent history and cultural heritage. The Web Sciences and Digital Libraries (WS-DL) research group at ODU has been studying web archives and building tools to help bridge the gap between the live web and the past web. This talk will highlight the importance of web archiving and outline several research projects currently in progress.</p>
