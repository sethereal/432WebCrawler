What did we learn from this?
• Webpages can go off-topic through time
• Some mementos aren't captured well
• Some mementos aren't replayed well

• In a world where the web browser is the
Internet, how can we make web archives
ubiquitous?

for Memento-Aware Browsers”, 2017
74. @weiglemc, @WebSciDL
What if browsers could natively
identify mementos?
• Look for Memento-Datetime header in
HTTP response
Memento-Datetime: Tue, 08 May 2012 11:24:30 GMT
• Use client-side rewriting (Emu) to improve
replay
• Use native UI elements to annotate
composite mementos

What if browsers could natively
interact with Memento aggregators?
• Alert users of unarchived pages as they
browse
• Provide UI elements to summarize and
access past versions of the current webpage
• Integrate web archives and the past web
into “New Tab View”

What if browsers could natively
interpret and replay WARCs?
• Users could share WARCs
• Recipient could open the WARC directly in
their browser
• WARC.js (ala PDF.js for WARCs)

What if browsers could natively

https://screenshots.firefox.com/9R5KvZEbbuk1NOOS/www.loc.gov
86. @weiglemc, @WebSciDL
What if these screenshots were
Memento-enabled?
• Provide Memento HTTP headers for the
screenshots
• Implement Memento datetime negotiation
for the entire screenshot cloud service
December 18, 2018 / Library of Congress 86
87. @weiglemc, @WebSciDL
We could build a crowd-sourced
archive of screenshots
• Take screenshot and save to Memento-
enabled screenshot cloud
• Option to push live webpage to archive at
same time
• Then we have both an archived page and a
screenshot of the page from very close to
the same datetime

It’s time for browsers to be
Memento-aware
• Web archives have gone mainstream.
• We’ve learned a lot by building tools to
enable personal use of web archives.
• These ideas need to be integrated directly
into browsers for general public use.
