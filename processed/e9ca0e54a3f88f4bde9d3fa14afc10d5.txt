Welcome to Mohamed Aturban's Homepage
Bio
I received my doctorate degree from Old Dominion University (Norfolk, Virginia) in 2020. I worked under the supervision of Dr. Michele Weigle and Dr. Michael L. Nelson . My research interests include: Web Science, Digital Library, Web Archiving, Computer Security, and Web Annotation. I received my Master's degree in Computer Science in 2011 from New Mexico State University (Las Cruces, NM) and my Bachelor of Science degree from University of Tripoli ( Tripoli , Libya )
