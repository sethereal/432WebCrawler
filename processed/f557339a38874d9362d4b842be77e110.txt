Project description: By focusing on informal settlements as a hard-to-reach site, this project establishes repeatable approaches for conducting research in hard-to-reach environments that combine different methods and epistemology, to create a many-models approach to evolving social science methods and evaluating available knowledge in complex, hard-to-reach environments.
