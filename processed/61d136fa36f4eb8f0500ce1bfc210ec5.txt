Fraternity & Sorority Life Conduct
Old Dominion University hosts more than 300 student organizations, providing students an opportunity to expand their growth and learning through leadership, service, and socializing with a diverse group of peers.
Student Organizations register each year with the university and are entirely student-led, may apply for funding from the Student Government Association to support annual costs, and are advised by an ODU Faculty/Staff member. Student Engagement and Traditions provides ongoing support to encourage the success of these organizations, their members, and their leaders.
Getting involved and joining a student organization will provide you with unique and fun opportunities to enhance your academic growth as well as your overall Monarch experience. With such a wide range of options, there's bound to be one just for you!
