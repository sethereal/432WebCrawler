About Me
I am an undergraduate student at Christopher Newport University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics and Leadership Studies. After completing my bachelor’s degree, I plan to either continue my education at CNU through the 5-Year Bachelor’s to Master’s Computer Science Program, or enter the industry as a database manager or front end developer.
Research Experience
This summer, I am participating in the Research Experiences for Undergraduates in Disinformation Detection & Analytics Program at Old Dominion University. I am specifically studying disinformation campaigns on Instagram under the guidance of Dr. Michele Weigle.
