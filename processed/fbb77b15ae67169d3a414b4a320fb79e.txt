First-year Student Scholarship Information
Merit-based Scholarships
First-year applicants who apply with or without submitting test scores are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships. The awards are based on academic performance, managed by the Office of Admissions, and recipients are notified at the time of admission to the University.
Other Awards
Institutional and Endowed Scholarships, awarded by the Office of Financial Aid, are based on an applicant selecting "Yes" on the institutional question of the admission application and choosing from the appropriate categories. Alternatively, a student's co-curricular experiences or involvements typically noted on an Activity Resume can be emailed to FinAidScholars@odu.edu , notifying the Office of Student Financial Aid of eligibility that may be considered.
