Student Engagement & Traditions
Mission
Student Engagement & Traditions (SET) is designed to shepherd students through their Monarch experience from confirmation to commencement. Through orientation, campus activities and traditions, student organizations, and fraternities and sororities, SET provides opportunities for students to enrich their academic learning, develop hard and soft skills, contribute to the campus community, and prepare for post-collegiate life. Each functional area of SET can be found below.
Ready. SET. Go!
